# Catalyst UI

A personal project to build and document a set of reusable, modern UI components from scratch. This showcase demonstrates clean code, scalability, and best practices.

### [cite_start]Description of Approach [cite: 66]

I built two main components, `InputField` and `DataTable`, completely from scratch using a modern tech stack. The focus was on creating flexible and reusable components with a clean API, documented thoroughly using Storybook. [cite_start]Styling was handled with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach, and all code is written in TypeScript for type safety[cite: 53]. [cite_start]The project also includes basic unit tests to ensure component reliability.

### Tech Stack

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Storybook**
- **Vite**
